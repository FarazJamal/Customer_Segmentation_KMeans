# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project performs segmentation of customers using the K-Means clustering 
algorithm. It showcases the full workflow of an unsupervised machine learning pipeline.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Elbow method for optimal k selection
- Cluster formation and visualization
- Business insights from cluster profiles

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset
2. Perform feature engineering and scaling
3. Use elbow method to determine number of clusters
4. Train K-Means model
5. Visualize and interpret clusters

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Unsupervised learning
- Feature engineering
- Cluster analysis and interpretation
